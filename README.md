# Image_Colorization

Automatic colorization deals with coloring greyscale images without any direct human assistance. Our approach is able to recognize textures that corresponds to different objects and properly color them. We design and build a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accepts a black and white image as an input and generates a colorized version of the image as its output.
